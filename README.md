# reminder_app This is an application written in javascript, react.js, semantic-ui, and php for the backend and integrate a 3rd party API 
Twilio to handle sms notification requests.  

The purpose of this application is for physicians and clinics to help reduce patient no-show appointments.  The physician will be
able to directly send a reminder sms notification to the patient's cell phone by including their name, the date of the appointment, and time
along with any brief message to bring any necessary paperwork to their next appointment.  

I thought about going a step further and have incentives for patients by connecting retail and clinics together as way of reducing their 
patient no-shows.  A doctor can offer any additional coupons or discounts of their own or choose to insert a retailer that will be 
partnered with local or national retail businesses in the area or a well-known organization, such as (Walmart, Walgreens, Rite-Aid, etc.)
as a way of to promote health.  For example, Rite-Aid will be able to partner up with us to provide coupons and discounts or reminders to 
get your flu shot in flu season.  This will be a win for everyone reduced patient no shows for doctors rise in revenue, health insurance 
companies increase in profits and patient will gain better overall health.

This application is a work in progress.  Estimated deadline for project is Jan 31, 2019
